First create a terra vector file using process_coordinates.r
 
For mean climate data from http://climate.geography.hawaii.edu/interactivemap.html
Then use template r code to extract the data

For monthly raster data extraction:
processing_daily_HCDP_data.r is a script to clean up the daily/monthly raster files downloaded from hcdp
extract_rasters_timeseries.r then can be adapted to extract data from the monthly files
